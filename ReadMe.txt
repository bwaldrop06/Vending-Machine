***IF YOU USE GIT RESET WHEN YOU HAVE UNCOMMITTED LOCAL CHANGES, YOU WILL LOSE THEM FOREVER***

There is a commit for every user story. To see a specific commit and walk your way through, you can use

git reset --hard <commit hash>

To find the commit hash, click on Commits and select the one you want.

For instance, to look at the code for JUST the first user story, cd into the sample-code repo and run the following:

git reset --hard f67a05a


****THIS IS NOT A MAGICALLY MAKE GIT READ YOUR MIND COMMAND*****

****DO NOT RUN GIT RESET ANYWHERE ELSE OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON UNLESS AN INSTRUCTOR TELLS YOU TO!****
